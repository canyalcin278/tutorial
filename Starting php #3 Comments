Comments

  A comment in PHP code is a line that is not executed as a part of the program. Its only purpose is to be read by someone who is looking at the code.
  
  Comments can be used to:
  
 - Let others understand your code
 - Remind yourself of what you did
 - Comments can remind you of what you were thinking when you wrote the code
 
 Example
 
 <?php
// This is a kind of comment

# This is also a kind of comment
?>
