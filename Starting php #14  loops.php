/* PHP Loops
Often when you write code, you want the same code to run over and over again a certain number of times. So we use loops.

Loops are used to execute the same code again and again, as long as a certain condition is true.

In PHP, we have the following loop types:

while - loop through code as long as the condition is true
do...while - loop through code once, and then repeats the loop as long as the condition is true
for - loop through code a number of times
