Ä°n php we have some basic keywords:
(if, else, while, echo)
like these
*/

EXAMPLES

#1 => echo
/*
in php if we want to write someting in screen we use echo
*/

<?php
     echo "hi";
 ?>
 
 #2 => if
 if is very simple its means if
 
<?php
if ($a > $b)
    echo "a is bigger than b";
?>

#3 => while
we use while to creat a loop like so

<?php
$x = 1;

while($x <= 5) {
  echo "The number is: $x <br>";
  $x++;
}
?>
?>

#4 => else
we  use else for an other option
<?php
if ($a > $b) {
    echo "a is bigger b";
} else {
    echo "a is smaller b";
}
?>
